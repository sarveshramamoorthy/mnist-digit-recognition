# mnist-digit-recognition

We aim to correctly identify digits from a dataset of tens of thousands of handwritten images.

MNIST ("Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology") is the de facto “Hello World” dataset of computer vision. Since its release in 1999, this classic dataset of handwritten images has served as the basis for benchmarking classification algorithms. As new machine learning techniques emerge, MNIST remains a reliable resource for researchers and learners alike.

**Approach**

We use Keras (with TensorFlow as our backend) as the main package to create a simple neural network to predict digits from handwritten images. Also, we will be experimenting with various optimizers: Stochastic Gradient Descent optimizer, Adam optimizer and Adamax optimizer. However, there are many other parameters which I will be experimenting with in the future.
